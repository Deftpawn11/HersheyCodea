Some notes on usage: 

Each font is stored in it's own class file - for example, RomanSimplex.lua is a self-contained class
for the Hershey Roman Simplex font. The code in each class file should be identical - the only
thing that changes is the data describing the font. To use a font, all you need to do is grab the
single file containing the class for that font, and put it in a tab in your Codea project. 

The main.lua is full of demonstrations on how to use the fonts, along with some examples of doing things
like spinning text, changing colors, scrolling text, etc. The only *required* part of that main.lua is
the first call in setup that instances the font class ( "f = HersheyRomanSimplex()" in this example ).
